# @Value

This annotation is used at the field, constructor parameter, and method parameter level. The @Value annotation indicates a default value expression for the field or parameter to initialize the property with. As the @Autowired annotation tells Spring to inject object into another when it loads your application context, you can also use @Value annotation to inject values from a property file into a beanâ€™s attribute. It supports both #{...} and ${...} placeholders.
