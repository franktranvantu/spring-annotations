# @Lazy

This annotation is used on component classes. By default all autowired dependencies are created and configured at startup. But if you want to initialize a bean lazily, you can use @Lazy annotation over the class. This means that the bean will be created and initialized only when it is first requested for. You can also use this annotation on @Configuration classes. This indicates that all @Bean methods within that @Configuration should be lazily initialized.
