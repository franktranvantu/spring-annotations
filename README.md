# @Qualifier

This annotation is used along with @Autowired annotation. When you need more control of the dependency injection process, @Qualifier can be used. @Qualifier can be specified on individual constructor arguments or method parameters. This annotation is used to avoid confusion which occurs when you create more than one bean of the same type and want to wire only one of them with a property.
